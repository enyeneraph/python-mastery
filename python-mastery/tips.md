# Lessons
Motivation: Every now and then, it is always a good ida, to revisit the basics. You learrn mor. You identify gaps in your knowledge and you create a foundation for deeper knowledge.


## Notes
1. Use  python -i for debugging 
2. Given  a dictionary, `prices = { 'IBM': 91.1, 'GOOG': 490.1, 'AAPL':312.23 }` `list(prices)` does what a rookie would want `list(prices.keys())` to do


Questions
1. What is a read-eval loop? It says python interpreter runs that.
2. What is `sys.argv`?
3. Randoms and seeds
4. What are the encodings for txt data, and what are they dependent on? 
5. What encodings does python assume? Why? What alternatives exist? When are these alternatives necessary? When might you want to give it a different encoding?  
6. What kind of project would I need to be engaged in, to use binary encoded data
7. How to read, write binary encoded data (bytes_object.deecode())

# Todo
1. Use the other types of formatting other than the f-string. i.e `.format` and `%` 
2. Read more on bytes. [Resource](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Concepts/Bytes_objects_and_Bytearrays#Conversion_from_bytes_object)
